Description: Provides 'ggplot2' themes that mirror works from popular culture, such 
    as Barbie, Star Wars, Game of Thrones, and others. The package currently holds 
    14 themes and a number of corresponding discrete color scales, palettes, and 
    fonts. Each theme (e.g., 'theme_barbie') generates a unique color scheme and 
    font for a 'ggplot2' object that matches the color scheme and font found in 
    the movie, TV show, or video game.
